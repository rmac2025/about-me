    <h1>Hi, I'm Ross</h1>
    <p>
      I believe that when you approach CS as a consultative partner (as opposed to a vendor), you can build strong relationships focused on delivering value over everything else.
      Every customer is different, and once I understand what their definition of success looks like to them, I hit the ground running wrangling the resources on my end to get shit done.
  
    </p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Early in my career, I took the CliftonStrengths assessment while reflecting on what I wanted to be doing, and it helped me understand what my talents are and how I can put them to work -- here they are (stack-ranked, if you're curious)
      1. Strategic
      > "They create alternative ways to proceed. Faced with any given scenario, they can quickly spot the relevant patterns and issues."
      2. Ideation
      > "They are fascinated by ideas. They can find connections between seemingly disparate phenomena."
      3. Individualization
      > "They are intrigued with the unique qualities of each person. They have a gift for figuring out how different people can work together productively."
      4. Intellection
      > "They are characterized by their intellectual activity. They are introspective and appreciate intellectual discussions."
      5. Empathy
      > "They can sense other people's feelings by imagining themselves in others' lives or situations."

      I've spent a lot of time and effort developing these strengths into skills that I apply in everything I do, which is how I found myself in Customer Success.

    <h2>My Philosophy of Customer Success</h2>
    <p>
      Build Trust through Curiosity and Support
      - Approach every customer interaction with curiosity and excitement about their work to be seen as an extension of their team. They know they can rely on me for honest, actionable support whenever possible.
      Customer-Centric Mindset
      - Focus on getting the know the customers on a personal level -- understand their motivations, needs, and objectives. Figure out how we can partner together to form a mutually beneficial relationship.
      Be Genuine and Transparent
      - Inauthentic interactions in the working world are incredibly common
      Prioritize Long-Term Relationships
      - Prioritize the customer's needs and avoid pushing anything not relevant -- knowing their business helps to maintain and nurture long-term symbiotic partnerships.

    <h2>Fast <code>gzip</code> compression</h2>
    <p>
      To help ensure the smallest possible file sizes for your static assets,
      the Vercel Edge Network compresses files by default using
      <code>gzip</code>. You can also optionally use
      <code>brotli</code> compressesion if you prefer.

    <h2>Advanced routing configuration</h2>
    <p>
      Vercel gives you a variety of ways to configure the routing of your
      website. For example, adding redirects, rewrites, or headers to your page.
      While you can use <code>vercel.json</code> to define these through JSON,
      you can also express your routing configuration as code using
      <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-middleware"
        >Vercel Edge Middleware</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Middleware runs before the
      <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/caching"
        >Vercel Edge Network Cache</a
      >, so you can configure routing exactly as your application needs. For
      example, this template uses <code>middleware.js</code> defined in the root
      of the repository to add additional security headers to the site:
    </p>
    <pre><code>referrer-policy: origin-when-cross-origin
strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
x-content-type-options: nosniff
x-dns-prefetch-control: on
x-frame-options: DENY</code></pre>
